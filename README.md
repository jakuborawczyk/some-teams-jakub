# some-teams-jakub

<b>Project Overview</b>
This project features a website that showcases football teams and provides information about each club, including their league, city, UEFA rank, and official website. The layout is designed to be minimalistic yet luxurious, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface. The website is built using PHP for server-side processing and utilizes HTML and CSS for front-end presentation.

About Me
I am a passionate web developer at 19 years old, with an interest in creating digital solutions. My journey began in 2019 with an internship at Albert AB, where I discovered my calling for web development. After a year, I had the opportunity to work as a QA tester during the summer, marking the start of my deeper exploration into the programming world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends and continually expanding my skill set.

Code Explanation
HTML & PHP Structure
The application employs a foreach loop to iterate through an array of football teams. Each team is displayed in a "card" format, featuring:

Team Logo: An image representing the club.
Team Name: Displayed prominently as a header.
UEFA Rank: The ranking of the club within UEFA competitions.
League, City, Group: Additional details about the club.
Official Website Link: A button to redirect users to the club's website.
Security Measures

target="_blank": This attribute in anchor tags opens links in a new tab, which enhances user experience by allowing users to view the club's website without losing their place on the app. It provides a seamless navigation experience.

htmlspecialchars(): This function is used to convert special characters to HTML entities, which helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By sanitizing user input, we ensure that any potentially harmful code is neutralized, providing a more secure application.

PHP Code Sorting
The PHP code sorts the teams based on their UEFA ranking. This is achieved by iterating over the $teams array and displaying them in order of their ranking, ensuring that the best teams are presented first. This logical arrangement enhances the user experience by allowing users to quickly identify the top-performing clubs.

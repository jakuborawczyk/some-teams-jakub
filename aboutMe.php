                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Jakub Orawczyk</strong>, a 19-year-old passionate about web development. My journey into programming started in 2019 during an internship at Albert AB, where I discovered my love for creating digital solutions. After a year, I had the opportunity to work there as a QA tester during the summer, diving deeper into the world of programming.</p>
                <p>Besides coding, I enjoy spending my free time with friends, exploring new things, and learning continuously. My mission is to create impactful web experiences that bring value to users.</p>
